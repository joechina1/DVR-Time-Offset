# DVR Time Converter (PWA)

This is a simple web app to convert **real-world time** to **DVR system time** when the DVR clock is offset.

## How it works
1. Enter the **current real time**.
2. Enter the **current DVR time** shown on the system.
3. Enter the **real time you want to review** (past incident).
4. The app shows the DVR timestamp you need to search.

## Setup on GitHub Pages
1. Create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you don’t have one.
2. Create a new repository named `dvr-time-converter`.
3. Upload these files (`index.html`, `manifest.json`, `cam.png`, `README.md`).
4. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from branch** → select `main` and `/root`.
5. Your app will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/dvr-time-converter/`.

## Add to iPhone Home Screen
1. Open Safari and visit your GitHub Pages link.
2. Tap **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**.
3. Now it behaves like a native app.
